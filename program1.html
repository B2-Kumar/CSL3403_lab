        <p>CSS box model is a container which contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding and the
            content itself. It is used to create the design and layout of web pages. It can be used as a toolkit for
            customizing the layout of different elements. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box
            according to the CSS box model. </p>
        <p>Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>borders</li>
            <li>margins</li>
            <li>padding</li>
            <li>Content</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following figure illustrates the box model. </p>

        <p>Border Area: It is the area between the box’s padding and margin. Its dimensions are given by the width and
            height of border.</p>
        <p>Margin Area: This area consists of space between border and margin. The dimensions of Margin area are the
            margin-box width and the margin-box height. It is useful to separate the element from its neighbors.</p>
        <p>Padding Area: It includes the element’s padding. This area is actually the space around the content area and
            within the border box. Its dimensions are given by the width of the padding-box and the height of the
            padding-box.</p>
        <p>Content Area: This area consists of content like text, image, or other media content. It is bounded by the
            content edge and its dimensions are given by content box width and height.</p>
